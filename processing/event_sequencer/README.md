## Processing - Event Sequencer

Makes use of the [processing.org](https://processing.org/) sketchbook to try out some ideas of rendering transitions of elements through a [state diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram)

### Example output: 

Below is a sample of the output, where the circles represent the states and the lines are representative of elements transitioning from one state to another.

### Visualization bindings:

* The color of the line denotes the _destination_ state of the elements in transition.
* The weight of the line denotes is scaled to the number of items transitioning.
* The size of the state cirle denotes the population of the state.

## Overview

The intent of this sketch was to:

- Gain a comfort level in [Processing][processing-home]'s drawing functions.
- Learn a bit more about the nuance of the geometry of Hockey rinks.
- Perhaps be a foundation to a parameterized rendering of a Hockey rink for a future sketch where the dimensions of rink can be altered. (e.g. illustrating how the geometry of the rink has changed overtime.)

## Interaction

This is a static sketch, which doesn't offer any interaction.

But, in the subsequent [sketch with puck trajctory calculations][sketch-hockey-01], which computes the direction the puck will bounce off of the wall, you can move the puck around and see where it would go.


Dimensions were obtained from:

- [nhl.com][nhl-ice]

## Overview

The intent of this sketch was to:

- Gain a comfort level in [Processing][processing-home]'s drawing functions.
- Learn a bit more about the nuance of the geometry of Hockey rinks.
- Perhaps be a foundation to a parameterized rendering of a Hockey rink for a future sketch where the dimensions of rink can be altered. (e.g. illustrating how the geometry of the rink has changed overtime.)

Dimensions were obtained from:

- [sportsknowhow.com][sportsknowhow-hockey]
- [nhl.com][nhl-ice]

## Overview

This is a [Processing][processing-home] sketch inspired by the [Coding Train's][coding-train] [Coding Challenge #2][ct-challenge-2] on create a [Menger Sponge][wiki-menger-sponge].

Keys:

- `w` and `s` move in and out respectively
- `UP` / `DOWN` tilts the object forward and back
- `LEFT` / `RIGHT` rotates the object around a vertical access
- `c` resets the iteration to the first step
- `r` toggles the rotation on / off.

Mouse:

- Click (anywhere) ... generates the next step in the recursion (up to a limit, to avoid generating too many boxes)

# fieldeq
A collection of equations, to create various Vector fields

The intent of this sketch is to experiment with alternate 

Currently the fields have to be toggled on/off via code.

Fields are:

* LotkaVolterraEquation
* SimpleWind
* SinuousWind
* OddEvenWind
* StackedWind
* MultiStackedFields
* GravityField
* LorentzEquation

## Controls
(while holding the mouse)

`a` - Will add a ball, you can pull it back like a slingshot and release.

`d` - Will drop a ball every 50 pixels

`c` - Will empty the array of balls

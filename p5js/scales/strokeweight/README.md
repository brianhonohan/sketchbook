## Overview

This is a [p5.js][p5js-home] sketch that is part of a series that I call "scales". Borrowing from the idea of learning and practicing piano scales, these are intended as a set of sketches to get first hand experience with the options and modes that p5.js offers in its drawing library.

What is exercised in this sketch is the [p5.js strokeWeight()][p5js-strokeweight] function which controls how thick / thin p5.js draws lines.

In particular, I was curious about how really thin and really thick a line could be drawn.


## Controls

* Slider for controlling the background color

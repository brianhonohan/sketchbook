## Overview

This is a [p5.js][p5js-home] sketch that is part of a series that I call "scales". Borrowing from the idea of learning and practicing piano scales, these are intended as a set of sketches to get first hand experience with the options and modes that p5.js offers in its drawing library.

What is exercised in this sketch is the [p5.js paletteLerp()][p5js-palettelerp] which allows for lerping through a series of colors.

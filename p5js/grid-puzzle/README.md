## Overview

This is a [p5.js][p5js-home] sketch which creates a simple puzzle where you need to click pairs of tiles to match colors of background and nested squares to clear the board.

This is a re-implementation of the [NY Times Tiles puzzle][nytimes-tiles-game]. I programmed this during the summer of 2020 during the pandemic as a distraction.


Originally sketched in the p5.js Editor interface in [this collection][p5editor-collection].

## Overview

This is a [p5.js][p5js-home] sketch which creates a simple puzzle where you need to click pairs of tiles to match colors of background and nested squares to clear the board.

This is based on the NY Time puzzle, and something I programmed in summer of 2020 during the pandemic as a distraction.


## Controls

Click on squares of matching colors to remove them.

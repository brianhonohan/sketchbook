# Water Cycle

## Idea:
Model the Water Cycle through Finite Element Analysis.

Intent of this sketch is to create a 2D view of the water cycle.

Starting with a view divided into 4 main sections:

- left most quarter is a lake/ocean where water will predominantly evaporate
- second quarter is a flood plain
- third quarter is the foothills
- fourth quarter is a slope of a mountain range

May add a fifth section, for the otherside of the mountain, to demonstrate a rain shadow.

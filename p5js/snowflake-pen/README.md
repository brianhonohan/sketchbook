## Overview

This is a [p5.js][p5js-home] sketch that allows you to draw a snowflake.

It does this by allowing the user to draw in a particular area, and then repeating that across radial divisions of a circle centered on the canvas.

## Controls

Mouse 

- `Click & Drag` - Will draw lines, but only in the sliver between the what amounts to "12 o'clock" on an imaginary clock face, and about "1:30" on the same clock face. (Click around, you'll get the hang of it).

Keyboard

- `p` - Will download a `.png` image file of your drawing to your computer.
- `c` - Will clear the canvas.

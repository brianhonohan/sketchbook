This is a [p5.js][p5js-home] sketch inspired by the [Coding Train's][coding-train] [Coding Challenge #11][ct-challenge-11] on create a 3D terrain to fly over.

If I recall correctly, I mostly followed along in the video which was done using Processing (Java) and was dynamically porting it to p5.js web experience.

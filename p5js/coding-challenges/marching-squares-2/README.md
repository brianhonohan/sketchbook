## Overview

This is a [p5.js][p5js-home] sketch implementing the basic Marching Squares algorithm, inspired by [Coding Train's video - Coding Marching Squares
][coding-train-yt-marching-sq].

In this iteration:
* Enhance this by using interpolation to have smoother lines 


Next steps in upcoming sketches / iterations
* Fix the issue of not connecting the isolines to the left and top window edges.
* Allow for multiple steps within the 2D value field


## Controls

(No interactivity implemented yet).

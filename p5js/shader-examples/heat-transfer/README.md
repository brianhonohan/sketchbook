## Overview

The very basic heat-transfer shader, where heat is represented by red-level (above 0.2 on 0-1 scale) and coolness, or lower end of heat, is represented by blue-level (above 0.2 on blue scale).

## Controls

* Press `D` to change mouse to remove heat mode.
* Press `E` to change mouse to add heat mode.

Click and draw on the canvas to add/remove heat.

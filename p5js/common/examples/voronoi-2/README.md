## Overview

This is a [p5.js][p5js-home] sketch to demonstrate the a revised version of `p5.voronoi` library which enables having multiple diagrams in parallel with each other; and allows for the reliance / utilization of p5.js styling control for all but the sites.

## Controls

Mouse
* Clicking (or pressing on mobile) will regenerate and redraw the diagram in that quadrant.
